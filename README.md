# Data Analysis in R 
This project showcases a complete data analysis workflow using R programming. It includes tasks such as data visualization, data wrangling, statistical analysis, and geospatial mapping. For data visualization, the ggplot2 and plotly packages were used to create clear and informative graphs. Data wrangling was done using dplyr and tidyr to clean and organize the data. Statistical analysis was carried out with the stats and MASS packages to discover patterns and relationships. For geospatial mapping, the sf package was used to display data on maps. This repository provides the scripts and methods used for each task, offering a practical guide for effective data analysis in R.
